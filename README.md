# Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis

An interactive **Power BI Data Analytics Project** analyzing global population, economic growth, health, and literacy trends from **1960–2017** using SQL, Excel, and DAX.

---

## Project Overview

This project transforms large, multi-source global datasets into meaningful insights using **Power BI**. It analyzes long-term demographic and economic trends and presents them through interactive dashboards that enable regional and country-level comparisons.

The goal is to uncover relationships between **population, GDP, literacy, and health indicators** to support data-driven understanding of global development patterns.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze global and regional **population growth** and **GDP trends**
- Study the relationship between **economic performance, health, and literacy**
- Build interactive **Power BI dashboards** with KPIs and slicers
- Enable country and region-level comparative analysis
- Identify long-term global development patterns and disparities

---

## Dataset Description

The project uses historical global datasets (1960–2017) including:

- Population data per country  
- GDP and GDP per capita  
- Infant mortality rates  
- Literacy rates  
- Country and region attributes  

**Data Sources:** SQL databases and Microsoft Excel files

---

## Data Preparation

- Data imported using Power BI connectors  
- Cleaned using **Power Query**
  - Handled missing values  
  - Standardized country and region names  
  - Corrected data types  
- Merged datasets using **Country, Region, and Year**
- Built relationships for accurate data modeling

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Import** – SQL + Excel integration  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Power Query transformation  
3. **Data Modeling** – Table relationships created  
4. **DAX Calculations** – Measures for growth, averages, rankings  
5. **Dashboard Development** – Interactive visual analytics  

---

## Dashboard Features

### KPIs
- Highest and Lowest GDP per Capita  
- Population Growth Trends  
- Literacy and Infant Mortality Indicators  

### Visualizations
- Bar & Column charts (GDP, literacy, population)
- Line charts (trend analysis over years)
- Maps (geographic population insights)
- KPI Cards (key metrics)
- Slicers (Country, Region, Year)

---

## Analysis & Insights

- Regions with higher literacy often show stronger economic performance  
- Infant mortality decreases as GDP per capita increases  
- Population growth varies significantly across regions  
- Developed regions show economic stability  
- Developing regions require policy focus  

---

## Statistical Analysis

- Mean, Median, Standard Deviation for population  
- GDP per capita comparisons  
- Literacy and mortality rate distribution  
- Growth trend analysis (1960–2017)

---

## DAX Functions Used

- `CALCULATE`
- `FILTER`
- `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- `MEDIAN`, `STDEV.P`
- Ranking measures

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**
- **SQL**
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Power Query**
- **DAX**

---

## Use Cases

- Global development analysis  
- Economic research  
- Policy planning insights  
- Educational and health trend studies  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI can integrate, model, and visualize multi-source global datasets to reveal meaningful economic and demographic insights through interactive dashboards.
